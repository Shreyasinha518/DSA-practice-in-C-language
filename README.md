# DSA-practice-in-C-language
📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains my complete Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice implemented in C programming language.
It is designed to build a strong foundation from basics to advanced topics, following a structured and topic-wise approach.

All programs are written with clarity, proper logic, and focus on understanding core concepts rather than just memorization.

🚀 Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

IDE / Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Operating System: Platform independent (Windows / Linux / macOS)
